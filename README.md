# Nice To Meet YouðŸ‘‹
#### I've dreamed of working in IT / electronics since I was little, I'm certainly not very strong, but I do it for fun. I often have a lot of ideas, sometimes more interesting than others and also I have always been very imaginative, which is what perishes me, I think of being a developer.I also have talent in drawing and math, but especially in development in my college I was a "god" in computer science while I didn't find it too much.
